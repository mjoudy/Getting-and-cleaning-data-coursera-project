# Getting-and-cleaning-data-coursera-project
This is the final project of 3rd course from Data Science Specialization of john Hopkins University in Coursera.com

Given Data description:

In this project the given data sets have gathered from accelerometer of a Samsung Galaxy S smartphone of 30 volunteers. Owner of these devices have requsted to do six different activities so that the relevant data capture by smartphone.
THe gathered data have been analyzed respect to spatial axeses and ... and many different statistical features from that have been extracted.
Number of total volunteer participated in the experiment is 30 which is presented by an ID. 

Procedure of code:
The first aim of this code is to merge and clean all of this data sets (features, activities, ...) correctly based on ID. Proceedingly, I extracted only the columns (features) which are about mean and standard deviation (std) of a measurement. Next, I rename the variables( features) and activity names based on relevant given .txt file. last part is the most important and complicated one. I calculated the mean of each feature for every activity and also for each person and made a new tidy, ordered table with these new variables.
